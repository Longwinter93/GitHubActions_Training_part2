<br>We are going to exercise Activity Types and Branch Event Filter
<br>Activity Types are used to run workflows if any events are activated. For example, a pull request is opened
<br>Event Filters are used to run workflows if we target specific branches
<br>We also add that workflows will not be run if changes are made in specific files/folders
